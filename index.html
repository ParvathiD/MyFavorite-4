        <p>Hermione Granger is an important character in the Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth. Both her parents were muggles (non-magical people) Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin, loved to hate on Muggles. He took particular pleasure in taunting Hermione. Malfoy called her 'Mudblood', a very grave insult referring to a wizard or witch born to non-magic parents.She arrives at Hogwarts (school of witchcraft and wizardry) when she ws nearly 12 years old. Hermione is known for being studious, driven, organized, and is easily the brightest witch of her generation. Although she irritates Harry and Ron at first, they develop a friendship unrivaled by any other. Many wonder how she wasnâ€™t placed in Ravenclaw with the other 'keen minds,' it becomes clear that her bravery and loyalty to her friends is what makes Hermione a true Gryffindor.</p>
